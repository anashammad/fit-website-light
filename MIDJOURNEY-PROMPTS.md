## General Tips for All Prompts

1. **Seed consistency:** After generating a base image you like, note the seed value and reuse it with `--seed [number]` to maintain visual consistency across the set.
2. **Upscaling:** Use Midjourney's built-in upscaler or generate at `--quality 2` for print-ready assets.
3. **Color accuracy:** Midjourney interprets hex codes loosely. After generation, adjust exact brand colors in Photoshop or Figma using color overlay or hue/saturation adjustments.
4. **Text on images:** Midjourney cannot reliably render text. Plan to add all labels, product names, and UI text in post-production using Figma or Photoshop with the brand typeface.
5. **Batch workflow:** Generate 4 variations per prompt, select the best composition, then upscale and color-correct before placing on the website.
6. **Stylize parameter:** For more controlled, less artistic output, add `--s 50` (lower stylization). For more dramatic hero images, use `--s 250`.
7. **Post-processing checklist:**
   - Verify brand color alignment (#0f4c81 navy, #e8a838 gold)
   - Add any required text overlays
   - Crop to exact aspect ratio for the website component
   - Export as WebP for web (with JPEG fallback) at appropriate dimensions
